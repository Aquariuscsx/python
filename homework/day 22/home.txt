Remember me, no time cannot erase pass 
I can hear your  pass whispers in my mind 
I've become what you pass cannot embrace 
Our memory will be my lullaby 
Sing me to sleep now pass
Sing me to sleep 
Won't you sing pass me to sleep now? 
Sing me to sleep  pass
A-anytime 
I would do 
Time away 
Yesterday-day 
A-anytime 
I would do 
Time away 
Yesterday-day
